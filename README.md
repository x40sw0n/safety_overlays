# safety_overlays
A collection of overlays made for a Cyberpunk Streamyard Roleplaying game
This is a collection of overlay screens used for safety tools designed to work with the intention to keep games inclusive and consensual. More information on usage of these safety tools can be found here: https://www.montecookgames.com/consent-in-gaming/ 

Please feel free to use these with your game, and contribute further or modify them to the feel of your own campaign.
